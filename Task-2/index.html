                Rohit made his debut for the Indian cricket team in 2007, and since then, he has become one of the leading run-scorers and most successful captains. His aggressive yet graceful batting style has earned him admiration from fans and peers alike. Notably, Rohit is the only player to have scored three double centuries in One Day Internationals (ODIs), a testament to his exceptional batting prowess.
                
                In 2019, Rohit was appointed as the vice-captain of the Indian cricket team in ODIs and T20Is, and he has seamlessly led the team to numerous victories.
